## day 5

- reported panic in possum: https://github.com/mulias/possum_parser_language/issues/18 (see bug1.possum)

## day 3

- possum `scan` is renamed to `find` but my version still uses `scan`
- part2 more involved and I made a separate 03_2.possum file

this was fun, I enjoyed learning a more advanced pattern for possum

## day 1

- set up repo [x]

  - run possum with no arguments [x]
    - no need to notariza, just did `chmod +x` and executable is working for me! [x]
  - copied possum to `/usr/local/bin` [x]
