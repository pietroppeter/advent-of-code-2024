## any thoughts?

ok the feasibility thoughts thing is probably an occasional thing by now

- after a parsing day, a grid day
- in Nim I always do my grids by hand
- and I always end up doing them differently than last time
- this time I tried first using option from stdlib
- but they are awkward to use so I reverted to having a placeholder null character
- got tricked by the CrossMas thing, but recovered rather quickly
- this day is the first day I felt the need to use the test example
