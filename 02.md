## feasibility thoughts

- safe reports can be intuitevly understood as feasible solutions
- the decision variables can be taken as a sequence of integers
- the constraints can be expressed in terms of deltas of the report:
  - allIn(deltas, [1, 2, 3]) or allIn(deltas, [-1, -2, -3])
- but of course the allIn constraint is one I just made up and it will totally depend on the expressivity of the constraint solver
- furthermore the damped problem is also more complex (and either requires more expressivity or more complex decision variables)
