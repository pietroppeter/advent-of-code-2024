## parsing thoughts

instead of feasibility thoughts today is more interesting to add an explainer on possum parsing for part 2:

let me put here again the parsing code for convenience:

```
mul = "mul(" > tuple2_sep(int, ",", int) -> Args < ")" $ {"op": "mul", "args": Args}
do = "do()" $ {"op": "do", "args": []}
dont = "don't()" $ {"op": "dont", "args": []}
array(scan(mul | do | dont))
```

reading from bottom to top:
- array(scan(mul | do | dont)) is the main parser: it produces an array of things. Thing is either a mul or a do or a dont. The scan keyword (in current possum docs is find but last release still uses scan) tells you to keep scanning the input (and skipping) until it matches a thing
- a do or dont thing is a string literal. After match it produces (by using the "$" keyowrd) a json object with fields "op" and "args". This is needed to keep it consistent with the output of mul thing
- mul thing also produces a json output but you can see that arguments are the stuff that is extracted from literals and named with -> Args and reused later.
