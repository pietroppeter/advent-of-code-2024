# Feasibility thoughts for day 01

math notation is a very loose version of latex (the minimal amount I can write with $ and {})

- focus on sorting and not on the solution
- an interesting exercise is to think sorting as a OR problem

a simple modelling approach is:
- given a sequence s_i for i in 1 .. N
- consider the matrix P_i,j with boolean values {0, 1}
- P_i,j will be my decision variable (dimension is N^2)
- where P_i,j = 1 if value of index i is "moved" to place j
- P_i,j represents a permutation if it satisfies the following constraints:
    - Sum_j P_i,j = 1 and Sum_i P_i,j = 1
- in this case I can think P_i,j as a bijection P(i) = j
- and I can think of the permuted sequence s_j = s_P(i)
- note that if I think s_i as a vector x then I can think of s_j as vector y = Px
- and the linear relation with the two sequence is evident
- s_j is sorted if it satisfies the constraints s_j <= s_j+1
- these constraints can be translated into linear constraints on P (the x plays the role of weights)
- so **sorting is now translated into a constrained programming problem**
- note that there might be multiple solution in the case of sequences with multiple equal values
- in that case an "optimal" one can be selected by minimizing a loss, for example Sum abs(j-i)
- I guess this is some kind of transport loss

the modelling approach above is very expensive in terms of memory (NË†2 matrix!).
A better approach would be to do a local search in the space of permutations and
perform the search by applying iteratively swap operations between two indices.
In that case my decision variable is a sequence of integers  1..N where each integer appears only once. Swap operations preserve this invariant.
A natural arising question is: is there an algorithm for sorting with the minimal
amount of swapping?
